### This project was originally created using a library called "Raylib," but it did not meet my expectations and plans. As a result, I am now remaking the project using "SFML 3.0.0," which will allow for more advanced features and visuals for the type of project I'm working on. 
### Although the current state of the project is somewhat disorganized, I will continue to improve and develop it.
