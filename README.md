# SFML Data Structures Visualization

## Overview

This project is a C++ application that visualizes fundamental data structures using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). It provides an interactive way to understand stacks and queues by visually displaying their operations in a dynamic grid-based system.

## Note

This project was originally built using the Raylib library as part of a Data Structures course. However, it didn't fully meet my expectations or support the advanced features I had in mind. To improve flexibility and visuals, I decided to rebuild it using SFML 3.0.0. Progress has been slow due to other responsibilities, but I plan to continue developing it when possible.

## Key Features

- **Custom Grid System:** Organizes visual elements and ensures proper placement.
- **Stack & Queue Implementations:** Demonstrates Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO) behaviors.
- **Node Representation:** Uses circles and text to visually depict data elements.
- **Interactive UI Elements:** Includes buttons for adding and removing elements.
- **Configurable Window Settings:** Reads from a configuration file to allow easy customization.

## Technologies Used

- **Visual C++ 2022**
- **SFML** (Graphics rendering and UI interaction)

## Future Enhancements

- Add more interactive controls for user input.
- Implement additional data structures (linked lists, trees, etc.).
- Improve UI with animations and real-time updates.
